1.第 1 个问题
What is the running time of selecting the minimum element on each iteration of the selection sort?


O(\log n)O(logn)


O(n)O(n)


O(n^2)O(n 
2
 )


O(1)O(1)

Correct
Selecting the minimum of O(n)O(n) elements is O(n)O(n).

2.第 2 个问题
Can we use the merging procedure from the lectures to merge the arrays [1, 3, 2, 5, 4] and [5, 6, 7, 8, 9] in order to receive a sorted array?


No


Yes

Correct
Both arrays must be sorted prior to merging.

3.第 3 个问题
How many operations are needed to merge two sorted arrays of sizes mm and nn respectively?


O(nm)O(nm)


O(1)O(1)


O(m \log n)O(mlogn)


O(n + m)O(n+m)

Correct
Merge works in O(n + m)O(n+m).

4.第 4 个问题
Can you use Count Sort to sort an array of positive real numbers which are less than 100, such as [0.572, 0.25, 2.34, 3.14159, 2.781828, 42], in O(n)O(n) time?


Yes, because the numbers are bounded


No

Correct
Although the numbers in the array are bounded, Count Sort is not applicable, because it can only be applied to integer numbers: real numbers cannot play the role of indices of an array.
